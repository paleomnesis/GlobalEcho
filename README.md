# 🌐 GlobalEcho

Hi there 👋  
Thanks for checking out **GlobalEcho**, a small Minecraft plugin I built out of personal need and curiosity. It allows players to send simple, beautifully formatted announcements to everyone on the server — nothing more, nothing less.

This project isn’t trying to be flashy or revolutionary. It just does one thing, and (hopefully) does it well:  
**Let players speak to the whole server in a clear, elegant way.**

## 💬 Why I made this

I’ve always found that server-wide announcements are either too clunky, too ugly, or too hard to configure.  
So I made a tool that’s:

- Clean and minimalist
- Easy to customize
- Friendly for both players and server admins

It uses [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/) for formatting, supports Vault for optional economy features, and respects permissions and cooldowns. Nothing groundbreaking — just tidy, thoughtful code that should fit neatly into any server setup.

## ⚙️ How to use

The main command is `/islandannouncement`.

You can:
- View a formatting guide with `/islandannouncement guide`
- Send an announcement with `/islandannouncement announcement <your message>`
- Reload the configuration with `/islandannouncement reload` (requires permission)

If you use permissions or Vault, they’re supported out of the box.

## 📖 For developers

This plugin is fully modular — all managers, commands, and configuration layers are separated for clarity.  
You're welcome to read, learn from, or contribute to the code. It's intentionally written to be understandable and maintainable, not clever or overengineered.

If you have ideas, questions, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.  
I’ll read it. Maybe with coffee. ☕🙂

To you, for being curious.  
And to the open-source community, for giving me the inspiration and tools to build little things like this in the first place.
